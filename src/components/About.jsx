            Hi, I’m Mehedi, a passionate full-stack web developer with a love
            for building intuitive and dynamic digital experiences. My
            programming journey began with sheer curiosity—what started as
            simple HTML & CSS experiments quickly turned into a deep fascination
            with JavaScript, React, and the MERN stack. Over time, I refined my
            skills through hands-on projects and completed a full-stack MERN
            development course from Programming Hero, further solidifying my
            expertise.

            I enjoy creating scalable and interactive web applications that
            strike a balance between performance and usability. Whether it’s
            designing sleek UI components, optimizing backend performance, or
            integrating secure authentication and payment systems, I love
            tackling complex challenges through code. My favorite type of work
            includes developing interactive web apps, implementing modern
            front-end frameworks, and crafting solutions that enhance user
            experience.
          </p>

            Beyond coding, I have a deep appreciation for history, technology,
            and creative problem-solving. I love discovering new gadgets,
            exploring historical artifacts, and brainstorming innovative ideas.
            When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me diving into tech trends,
            learning about historical events, or experimenting with new side
            projects. These interests fuel my creativity and inspire me to build
            tools that make a real impact.
          </p>
          <p className="hover:bg-white transition border-zinc-400 hover:border-white border md:p-8 p-4 rounded-2xl">
            I firmly believe that learning never stops, and I’m always eager to
            explore new technologies, frameworks, and industry trends. If you’re
            looking for someone who’s not just a developer but also a creative
            thinker, problem solver, and lifelong learner, let’s connect and
            build something amazing!
